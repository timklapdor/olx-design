### Title

Choice Within Assessments

### Overview

Providing greater choice within an assessment is a great way to personalise the learning experience for each individual student. Subject enrolments often include students from a wide range of disciplines and assessment tasks can be developed to cater for this diversity. Questions can be aligned with different discipline areas and ask students to draw on those unique aspects of their society. Student could also have choice around the type of artefact they may produce - from essay through a presentation. 

### Engagement

Allowing students from a range of contexts to apply their own discipline knowledge and draw on their own experiences in their assessment makes the task more relatable and authentic. The student cohort for online learning courses at CSU is quite diverse in terms of the age, location and experience, and this can be a significant asset to a group of learners. Providing students with a choice between multiple questions, pathways and artefacts allows that diversity to be draw out and students can learn from each other. 

### Guide

There are a number of ways to provide greater choice to students in their assessment tasks:

- A common question may be responded to with a specific focus on a student’s context and draw from their personal experience or discipline area. 
- The form of the assessment may reflect the discipline of the student and the forms of communication common to that profession. So a ‘writing task’ may be presented as an essay, a report or news article depending on the student’s course of study.
- Students may wish a choice of medium for the assignment. Rather than write a traditional essay student could present their work as a presentation, multimedia artefact or video. This can broaden the student's range of communication skills and promote a variety of digital literacies.
