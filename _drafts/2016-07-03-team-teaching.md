### Overview
A Team Approach to teaching can include a number of staff teaching the subject at the same time but may also include looking beyond the immediate teaching staff to include relevant staff members from across CSU in the online space, in a students focused manner, e.g. making sure that library staff are included in the online teaching space for this subject. An example of this is the library staff hosting their own thread within the discussion forum of this subject. 

### Engagement

### In Practice

#### Subject
MGT100

#### Teaching Staff
 Dr. Wendy Webber 

#### Motivation
This motivated the development of a team approach, whereby various members of staff were present in the online teaching space to provide support for students in both a proactive and reactive manner. 

#### Implementation 
A key area of focus in MGT100 was the development of a ‘team’ approach to staffing within the online environment. The subject coordinator was complemented by an array of support staff who had a permanent presence within the Interact2 space-library staff, members of the ALLaN team, educational designers and of particular note, the inclusion of a ‘Student Mentor.’ 

#### Successes
An increase in threads generated by staff members (approx. 16% year on year increase), arguably a sign of increased and varied ‘teacher presence’
