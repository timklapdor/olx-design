### Overview

Recording Video Lectures for online students provides a richer engagement with the subject concepts than is possible with text. The sound and  ‘live’ nature of the resource helps convey the presence of the teacher. The tone of voice and other aspects of the audio contribute to students understanding of the topic and possible nuances in concepts. 

Video provides a rich medium to convey information but to also provide an avenue to embed some of the teacher's personality. 

### Engagement

Video Lectures provide a version of ‘the lecture’ that is more tailored to the online environment than providing a CSU Replay recording of the internal lecture, which can sometimes have issues with sound as the lecturer moves in relation to the microphone. The video lectures have become a resource used by internal students as well. 

### In Practice

#### Subject
SCI103

#### Teaching staff 
Ana Horta 

#### Motivation

The Video Lectures help the online students to feel that they are not missing out because of their study mode. They provide an effective way of augmenting the existing content students have and provide a timely way to address questions and provide support to the whole cohort of students. 

#### Implementation

The SCI103 video lectures include screen-captures as well as audio and video, and mostly range from 20-40 minutes. They were created to provide online  students with more coverage and explanation of the concepts presented in the online modules, textbook and recommended readings. Like lectures, there is one for each week. Through these video lectures the voice and personality of the lecturer comes through as a real human being, and so helps convey teacher presence. 

### Guide

### Tools

**[CSU Replay](https://www.csu.edu.au/division/dit/staff/training/self-help/teaching-technology-and-support)** provides a desktop capture solution that allows you to record and upload presentations back into the system for students to access.

> “Anderson, et. al. (2001) describe the design and organization aspect of teaching presence as the planning and design of the structure, process, interaction and evaluation aspects of the online course. Some of the activities comprising this category of teaching presence include re-creating Power Point presentations and lecture notes onto the course site, developing audio/video mini-lectures, providing personal insights into the course material, creating a desirable mix of and a schedule for individual and group activities, and providing guidelines on how to use the medium effectively.” - p3

>“Also, the increased ease with which media such as audio and video can be introduced into virtual learning environments may have significant implications for the structure, development, and interaction of the three presences (Arbaugh, 2005b; Stodel et al., 2006; Wagner, 2006).”

>“Certainly teaching in an online environment is influenced by the absence of the non-verbal communication that occurs in the face-to-face settings of conventional education, and the reduction in the amount of paralinguistic information transmitted, as compared to some other modes of distance education such as video or audio teleconferencing.” p. 14
