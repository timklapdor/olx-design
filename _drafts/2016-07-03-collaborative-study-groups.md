### Overview

### In Practice

#### Subject
MGT100

#### Teaching staff 
Dr. Wendy Webber 

#### Motivation
*MGT 100 Organisations and Management* is one of the foundational management subjects within the Faculty of Business at CSU. The Study Buddy groups were established first and foremost to address the sense of isolation that many students can feel despite  being part of a cohort that numbers in the hundreds. This subject is undertaken by students from a very diverse range of courses both within CSU and our partner institutions, meaning that it can be harder for students to easily find connections to students studying in similar courses or even similar geographical locations. 

#### Implementation
Students were grouped in ‘Study Buddy’ Groups which required them to engage with their fellow group members early in the session (prior to the first assessment) to increase their familiarity with the online learning environment and build some level of rapport with fellow students, as many students within MGT100 are entering higher education for the first time. As MGT100 has several hundred students each session, creating a sense of connectedness is an important consideration in the planning for this subject. Students were asked to complete the following tasks within their 15 person ‘Study Buddy’ small peer group, early in the session in order to successfully complete the first assessment task.

Students were able to enrol in any one of the 20 Buddy Groups, each of which contained a group discussion board where the Student Mentor was also present in conversations and responses. By engaging students in interactions in groups of no more than 20 students in the critical early phase of session, it was aimed to lessen potential anxiety and maximise opportunity for interaction rather than feel swamped by being one of many hundreds of students. 

#### Successes
Providing a clear structure for students to engage was key to ensuring that students had  opportunities to  collaborate and improve the overall chances of success. 

Forum activity as a gross measurement increased from 13 threads to 114 year on year, with an increase from 116 threads to 1287 different threads. 

Significant rises in overall student activity-10% increase in students who created a post along with a dramatic gross increase in students who posted (in similar size cohorts) year on year

### Guide
Don't create small groups without a clear understanding of how it will improve the student experience. Certain subjects and topics lend themselves to working in groups, as do certain student cohorts. Link with your structure with your teaching and learning and, ideally, your assessment practices. By creating a grouping experience and structure that incorporates assessment in some way you are more likely to garner the attention and participation of students, giving you the best chance of giving students the benefit of small group participation.
