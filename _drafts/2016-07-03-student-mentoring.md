### Overview

### Engagement

### In Practice:

#### Subject
MGT100

#### Teaching staff 
Dr. Wendy Webber 

#### Motivation
In a large cohort of first time students, it was also felt that providing an alternate voice besides the academic would provide students with further role modelling and an additional points of contact. 

#### Implementation
MGT100 inclusion of a ‘Student Mentor.’ This student mentor was a former student of MGT100 who was subsequently employed to provide both proactive and ‘just in-time’ engagement with students in the form of discussion board interaction and pre-emptive posts which acted as ‘sign posts’ for students-pointing them in the right direction for resources, tips on study and managing workload and assignment preparation, amongst other aspects. 

This Student Mentor was a critical component in planning the staff team approach within MGT100. As a former student of the subject the mentor was able to:

-  Provide regular updates to students in a ‘student friendly’ manner-informal tone.
- Give snippets of the mentor’s life alongside her study routines  which demonstrated the need to plan for study amongst outside commitments, a skill not always prevalent in new students.
- Provide timely reminders about accessing resources and planning ahead for assignment preparation and submission
- Position themselves within the Interact2 site as a ‘safe’ person for students to ask questions of via the discussion forums within each study buddy group. 

The student mentor posed a series of pre-agreed ‘pre-emptive’ posts ahead of key points in the subject i.e. providing students with the direct link to the referencing page in the days before an essay or exam tips ahead of the exam period. The student mentor was also given license to respond to student questions on a regular ad-hoc basis and was particularly effective in redirecting students to existing information.
