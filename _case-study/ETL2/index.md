introduction: "The ETL523 case study features these OLM elements - Teacher Presence, E-Assessment, Learning Communities and Interaction with the Professions. These elements are not present in isolation from each other. A combination of elements provide multiple strategies for subject implementation and often overlap and interconnect. The case study showcases these elements and attempts to reveal how vital it is we understand how they may co-exist and work together to improve engagement and enhanced learning outcomes."

### Background to ETL523

**{{ page.subject-code }} {{ page.subject-name }}** is a subject in the postgraduate degree Master of Education in Knowledge Networks and Digital Innovation (School of Information Studies). It explores the concept and practice of digital citizenship. Technological, political and ethical issues concerning digital citizenship are examined, including intellectual property, plagiarism, cybersafety, freedom of information, transliteracy and the effective use of a range of technologies to support learning and teaching. Issues in policy and practice are examined to understand how learning programs and school community practices can build capacity and resilience in students to enable them to become effective and responsible digital citizens in global online learning environments.
