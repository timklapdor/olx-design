        <p>Feeling part of a learning community and actively contributing to it is directly linked to student motivation and resilience. Studying within learning groups can be an important foundation for effective interaction between students, their peers and teachers in support of deeper learning. Proactive support from teachers for learning within smaller groups, provided synchronously or asynchronously, is important if the benefits of intellectual rigour and deep engagement are to be achieved.

        <h4>Networked communities</h4>
        <p>Groups are reconceptualised as networks and collectives of learning. The grouping occurs at point of need, around topic areas and ‘just in time’ to provide tailored learning experiences. These groups are porous and allow the community to extend beyond the class, often engaging with the profession and external peers. Tasks are often co-operative in nature requiring students to work together to produce their own unique output.</p>

        <h4>Communities of practice</h4>
        <p>Communities of practice are developed by students and teachers working together to engage in ways relevant to content, current issues and future professional practice. This can be achieved through the co-creation of authentic learning products where students contribute to the development of learning resources and study aids that develops their research skills and experience. Cooperative inquiry-based or problem-based learning activities and assessment tasks are strategically designed to facilitate student interaction, leadership and shared resources with the aim of lifelong learning and collaboration.</p>

        <p>The ultimate aim for any teacher is to develop a strong level of independence and self reliance in their students. This approach requires a strong commitment by the teacher as it challenges traditional student/teacher roles. Tone and structure of the learning environment needs to fosters student led learning that is supported with minimal intervention. Interaction between students, peers and lecturer is such that students have a sense of being in a learning community and that their learning is being enhanced by the group.</p>
