      "content": ""Overview  Asynchronous discussions are tasks that students can access and engage with at anytime, they do not have to be on their computer at a set time or in a set place. Asynchronous discussions are specifically designed to be flexible and are able to be engaged with at anytime in order to fit into the student’s study schedule, be it midday or midnight. These discussion can be made compulsory and tied to assessment tasks or optional and act as a support tool for students. Like all discussion tasks they need to have a specific purpose or discussion point in order to motivate students. While traditionally text based discussion forums have been the tool of choice,  there are a range of new tools that utilise rich media such as video and audio to facilitate these discussions.  Engagement  Providing asynchronous discussion opportunities from your students is an essential element of the Online/DE learning experience for all CSU students. If students are engaged with you as the teacher, and engaged with peers as learning colleagues, they are far more likely to participate and contribute, and achieve better results.  Additionally, ensuring that all subjects provide Asynchronous discussion opportunities is essential given the needs of our students whilst completing their degree. So many CSU Online students work part-time or even full time, are caring for children or sick relatives, or even travelling abroad for work. Students cannot always participate in the synchronous Online Meetings so they need suitable asynchronous engagement opportunities to integrate with their individual study schedules.  In Practice             Subject        EMT409: Technology for Adult Learning and Teaching        Teaching Staff        Alissa Brabin        Motivation        Throughout the Course, students were indicating they had minimal social interaction between themselves, and limited use of online tools. This subject was redesigned to focus on developing social presence, interaction between students and sharing of ideas and developing a Community of Practice (CoP). The early assessments and learning tasks were also designed as a stepping stone for developing a CoP as required in Assessment 3. Students reported that after 2 years of studying part-time as a cohort, this was the first time they had actually heard or seen each other!        Implementation        The lecturer used FlipGrid to provide short video updates to students throughout the session that were then embedded in the Home Page. FlipGrid was also used for assessment purposes for students to introduce themselves to the class and to engage students in a discussion about their own experiences with technology. There were only 46 students in this class but some of these videos had over 2000 views.                Guide  Be clear about the use of the tool as well as the question or focus of the activity. Linking discussions to Assessment provides an extrinsic motivation and can be a key strategy to encourage student participation. Be sure to make the engagement opportunities simple for student to access by providing embedded links to reduce the navigation required to find the point of engagement.  Different tools have different affordances and can be used in quite different ways:     Discussion Forums - Set up Forums with specific and structured questions designed for open discussion amongst students. Highlight recent events / current issues as applicable to real world practice. Academic may need to lead/closely monitor for the first 2-3 but aim for student lead discussion   Blogs - Ideally suited for summative assessments. If students are able to see and comment on each other’s work, they are more likely to engage due to the inherent benefit that a CoP offers.   Recordings of Online Meetings - always record Online Meetings and always provide the link to students. Those who could not attend are then given the chance to benefit from the interaction and questions of their peers.   FlipGrip - Allows the academic to ask a question or present discussion topic, and students create a 90 second video response using the URL provided. Easy and highly effective tool for developing a sense of community amongst learners by allowing them to see and hear each other. Videos embed easily into i2 pages. Flipgrid has a $60 annual fee for staff to create and use grids but is free for students to access and use.

      "content": ""Overview  Collaborative Group Projects are learning experiences designed to foster student interaction in order to achieve a shared goal - in many circumstances linked to assessment. These experiences are normally task based and more formal than e.g. ad hoc study groups. Group projects can take place in many circumstances and are often linked to a deeper level of instructional design and andragogy such as Project or Problem Based Learning or Scenario based learning. Collaborative Group Projects offer a range of benefits to students including utilisation and development of vital pre-professional skills, problem solving and collaborative skills and perhaps most importantly, students are provided with a source of ongoing feedback from peers, which can be a valuable source of learning and development for these students.  Engagement  The inclusion of a collaborative group project provides a range of affordances which can lead to deeper engagement for online and distance education students. First among these is that such tasks provide students with the chance to interact with others, potentially lessening the sense of isolation and perceived ‘distance’ between themselves and other students, the lecturer and the wider institution. Students can benefit from the chance to learn and express views in a smaller group, giving students the chance to learn in a more active way when compared to many individually based tasks.  In Practice             Subject        ITC105 : Communication and Information Management        Teaching staff        Anthony Chan        Motivation        As this is a communication subject, the learning activity was designed to help students share their work, their communication skills and further develop their own ideas on how to best respond to a workplace scenario, whilst developing digital literacy skills using Cloud services, and cooperative learning.        Implementation        The subject coordinator set up a shared Google Drive and Docs space for the students to access via a shared link. The students were provided with a workplace scenario on a disgruntled customer. Each student had to write a response to the customer using the Google Docs, enabling all students to view each other’s work. They provided comments and ideas for each other as well. Student were able to share their communication ideas, strategies and expression.

Guide  In looking for opportunities to develop and offer students an online collaborative group project, there are a range of considerations that need to be made:     Understand the ‘why.’ Chances are that many of your students are juggling the demands of life-work, study, family and social commitments. Be clear on the reasons why you want students to collaborate. Is this group collaboration going to improve their content knowledge or skills? Increase their ability to act in a professional or collegial manner or support attainment of one of CSU’s Graduate Learning Outcomes? Be linked to, or be the actual assessment task? Lived experiences suggest that offering collaborative group tasks without a very clear link to assessment and associated outcomes, prove to have very low levels of student engagement.   Authenticity - the group collaboration you’re planning should reflect some kind of real world task, issue or circumstance as relating to the discipline or profession in question. In some circumstances there may be scope to move from a scenario to real world project, the outcomes of which will be applicable in some way to a wider audience or issue beyond the university. Regardless, a measure of realism will help build and maintain student interest.   Practicality - Along with understanding why you want students to collaborate and what the substance of the collaborative efforts will be, it is equally important to consider how practical it is for your students to collaborate. Are you expecting your students to collaborate ‘in real time’ i.e. ‘synchronously’ or is it ok for them to complete their roles at a time that suits them i.e. ‘asynchronously.’ For example, expecting postgraduate shift working nurses to collaborate at the same time on a group task in an online meeting might be a much harder logistical exercise than first year undergraduate students. Is what you are intending to offer feasible for students to complete?   Collaboration - implies that the end result will not just be a compilation of individual work put together (typified by students ‘doing their part’) but that there is collective effort in creating a body of work that is representative of a genuine exchange of ideas and co-creation.   Assessment - considering how you will assess collaborative group work is important-will the group receive one mark or will individual members receive a mark as well? If so, what evidence will you rely upon to assign each mark-peer assessments, reflective tasks, journals and blogs and tracking of individual work input are all potential strategies, each with their own factors to consider.   Roles and Responsibilities-depending on the underlying andragogical and instructional design approach, e.g. ‘Problem Based Learning’ you may need to articulate the roles within a group and model and provide ongoing support for students as they fulfill these roles.   Tools  There is a wide variety of tools available to support the implementation of Collaborative Group Projects, many of them CSU supported technologies:     Adobe Connect Meeting Rooms - students can be offered their own adobe connect meeting room to collaborate on projects, with the added advantage that these meetings can be recorded. There are a range of useful approaches such as creating a layout for each stage of collaboration, which help track student involvement and participation. There are some limitations however, including the need to ensure that students have correct access permissions to edit their room layouts (or you will need to pre-design useful layouts for each group, which can be done as a bulk process).   CSU Interact-various functionalities-our learning management system, interact2, provides a ‘Group tool’ which has a range of functionalities such as a wiki, group discussion forums, file exchanges etc. Interact2 is a good solution for collaborative group work if this collaboration is primarily text based, and can be used as a centralised area for the group to organise themselves.   Google Docs-ease of access and a wide range of functionality within the google environment make it a useful tool for group collaboration, including the ability to have multiple editors working on a document simultaneously. Students can use features such as ‘hangouts’ to connect via video chat to collaborate within this space. It is important to note that as this is not an officially supported teaching and learning tool, CSU cannot ensure integrity-e.g.work lost or deleted in this space cannot be retrieved. Use of these third party services generally involves students signing up to create an account.   Video Conferencing Technologies - Skype, CSU video conferencing system - there are many choices available-circumstances dictate which way students will collaborate-   Discipline/profession specific collaboration tools-too many to list, but ensuring that students have appropriate access privileges by organising with the software vendor well ahead of the teaching and learning session is an appropriate design step   When planning and offering best practice is to provide a reliable, supported ‘default’ approach as well as articulating and modelling a range of ways in which collaboration can enriched-hopefully the default is also a best practice! There should be easy to access and understand help guides (text/audio/video) available for students so that they can trouble shoot minor problems themselves. If not, the creation of simple ‘how to guides’ may make your experience of facilitating Collaborative Group Projects all the more fruitful.  Further Reading      Hiltz, Starr Roxanne. (1997).
